# Welcome to my website!
hi
## I currently live in Sammamish, WA with my family of four.
### I made this website for tips on middle school and a self checklist for middle school.
#### My name is Minh and I'm a 6th grade representative for my school.
Tips
* Don't argue with your teacher
* Don't run around
* Do things to help others
     * Buying others lunch
          * _If they dont have one_
     * Help people get to their classroom
          * _If you know where it is_

### Let me ask you, did you do your homework yet? if you already did, you can ignore this, if not then below is a list of homework you might need to do.
* Math HW
* Science HW
* LA HW
* SS HW

How many classes did you come early or on time?
If yes then how many?
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5
* 6

### If you got 6 amazing job! If you didn't, you should try to be on time more.
