# Welcome to my website!
## I currently live in Sammamish, WA with my family of four.
### I made this website for tips on middle school and a self checklist for middle school.
Tips
* Don't argue with your teacher
* Don't run around
* Do things to help others
     * Buying others lunch
          * _If they dont have one_
     * Help people get to their classroom
          * _If you know where it is_

How many classes did you come early or on time?
If yes then how many?
* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4
* [ ] 5
* [ ] 6

### If you got 6 amazing job! If you didn't, you should try to be on time more.
